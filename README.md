In this tutorial, we will create a simple Todo List app. In the UI, you will have a text input field and an Add button. Type in a task or whatever you want into the text field and press Add (or hit Enter/Return). Once you've submitted your task, you will see it appear as an entry.  You can keep adding tasks to add additional entries and have them all show up.
